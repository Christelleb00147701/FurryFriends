            <h2 class="heading3">Fun Fact!</h2>
            <p>Did you know that rodents make up almost half of all mammal species on Earth? They are found in almost every habitat on the planet, from the deserts to the Arctic tundra. Some of the most common rodents include mice, rats, squirrels, guinea pigs, and hamsters. While many people keep rodents as pets, others consider them pests due to their tendency to cause damage to crops and buildings. Despite their reputation as pests, rodents play an important role in many ecosystems, serving as prey for larger animals and helping to distribute seeds and other plant material.</p>
